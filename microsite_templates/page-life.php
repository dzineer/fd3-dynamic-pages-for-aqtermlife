	                                    Life insurance is an essential part of financial planning. One reason most people buy life insurance is to replace income that would be lost with the death of a wage earner. The cash provided by life insurance also can help ensure that your dependents are not burdened with significant debt when you die. Life insurance proceeds could mean your dependents will not have to sell assets to pay outstanding bills or taxes. An important feature of life insurance is that generally no income tax is payable on proceeds paid to beneficiaries. The death benefit of a life policy owned by a C corporation may be included in the calculation of the alternative minimum tax.

	                                <p>Before buying life insurance, you should assemble personal financial information and review your family's needs. There are a number of factors to consider when determining how much protection you should have. These include:

	                                <ul>
	                                    <li>any immediate needs at the time of death, such as final illness expenses, burial costs and estate taxes.</li>
	                                    <li>funds for a readjustment period, to finance a move or to provide time for family members to find a job.</li>
	                                    <li>ongoing financial needs, such as monthly bills and expenses, day-care costs, college tuition or retirement.</li>
	                                </ul>

	                                <p>Although there is no substitute for a careful evaluation of the amount of coverage needed to meet your needs, one rule of thumb used: five to seven times annual gross income.

	                                Buying life insurance is not like any other purchase you will make. When you pay your premiums, you're buying the future financial security of your family that only life insurance can provide. Among its many uses, life insurance helps ensure that, when you die, your dependents will have the financial resources needed to protect their home and the income needed to run a household.<br><br>Choosing a life insurance product is an important decision, but it often can be complicated. As with any other major purchase, it is important that you understand your needs and the options available to you.<br><br>
	                                The main types of life insurance available are term and permanent. Term insurance provides protection for a specified period of time. Permanent insurance provides lifelong protection. </p>

	                                If you miss a premium payment, you typically have a 30- or 31-day grace period during which you can pay the premium. After that, the policy will lapse. You may be able to reinstate with evidence of insurability depending on your policy's provisions. If your policy has sufficient cash value, the company can, with your authorization, draw from a permanent policy's cash surrender value to keep that policy in force. This does not apply to term insurance because there is no cash value to draw from. In some flexible premium policies, premiums may be reduced or skipped as long as sufficient cash values remain in the policy. However, this will result in lower cash values. </p>

	                                    Medical tests can provide accurate and current information about an applicant's health, thus enabling insurers to charge premiums that reflect the level of risk an applicant represents. Because some health conditions are easily managed through proper medication, therapy or lifestyle changes, medical information sometimes makes it possible for insurers to cover applicants who might not otherwise be insurable. More serious or incurable conditions present an enormous risk that an insurer simply cannot assume.

	                                        Always name a "contingent," or secondary, beneficiary, just in case you outlive your first beneficiary.

	                                        Select a specific beneficiary, rather than having the proceeds of your life insurance paid to your estate. One of the great advantages of life insurance is that it can be paid to your family immediately. If it is payable to your estate, however, it will have to go through probate with the rest of your assets.

	                                        Be very clear in wording beneficiary designations. Naming specific children may exclude those born later. If your child dies before you, do you want the proceeds to go to that child's children? Changing the beneficiary designation is easy, but you have to remember to do it.

	                <p>
	                    Term insurance provides protection for a specific period of time. It pays a benefit only if you die during the term. The premiums are guaranteed during the level pay period. When purchasing a level term life insurance policy be sure you are aware of the guaranteed premium period. Once you have been approved and placed the policy in force with the first payment, the insurance company is obligated to keep the policy in force as long as you keep paying the premiums. You are not obligated to pay, but once you stop paying, the policy will lapse after usually a 30 day grace period. Some term insurance policies can be renewed when you reach the end of the level pay period. The premium rates increase at each renewal date. Most policies require that evidence of insurability be furnished at renewal for you to qualify for the lowest available rates.

	                    <li>Initially, premiums are generally lower than those for permanent insurance, allowing you to buy higher levels of coverage at a younger age when the need for protection often is greatest.</li>
	                    <li>It’s good for covering specific needs that will disappear in time, such as mortgages or car loans.</li>
	                    <li>The longer level term products can provide coverage as long as most people might need life insurance.</li>

	                <ul class="aq-list">
	                    <li>Premiums increase as you grow older, after the term selected expires, providing it renews past that term.</li>
	                    <li>Coverage may terminate at the end of the term or may become too expensive to continue.</li>
	                    <li>Generally, the policy doesn't offer cash value or paid-up insurance.</li>

	                <h3 class="header3">Here are a few tips to keep in mind when purchasing a life insurance policy:</h3>
	                <p>
	                	Take your time. On the other hand, don’t put off an important decision that would protect your family. Make sure you fully understand any policy you are considering and that you are comfortable with the company and product.<br><br>After you have purchased an insurance policy, keep in mind that you may have a “free-look” period usually 10 days after you receive the policy during which you can change your mind. During that period, read your policy carefully. If you decide not to keep the policy, the company will cancel the policy and give you an appropriate refund. Review the copy of your application contained in your policy. Promptly notify the agent or the company of any errors or missing information.
						<br><br>Review your policy periodically or when your situation changes to be sure your coverage is adequate.

	                <h3 class="header3">What happens if I fail to make a the required payments</h3>
	                <p>
	                	If you miss a premium payment, you typically have a 30- or 31-day grace period during which you can pay the premium with no interest charged. In a term policy at the end of the grace period if you do not make a payment the policy will lapse. In a permanent policy, the company can, with your authorization, draw from a permanent policy's cash surrender value to keep that policy in force as long as there is sufficient cash surrender value. In some flexible premium policies, premiums may be reduced or skipped as long as sufficient cash values remain in the policy. However, this will result in lower cash values.

	                	Most policies offer a waiver of premium rider at an additional cost. With this rider, if you become totally disabled for a specified period of time, you do not have to pay premiums for the duration of the disability.
