	                                    The simplest and easiest part is getting a quote using the Term Life Quote Engine. Once the information is completed on the input page and the "Get A Quote" button is clicked, the product comparison page is displayed. The first thing noticed, there are four rate classifications shown in each product strip. After the underwriting process is complete, the applicant can expect to receive an offer of one of these underwriting classifications from the insurance carrier if the application is not rated or declined.
	                                    <br><br>
	                                    The criteria used by each insurance carrier to determine the underwriting classification can be reviewed by viewing the Underwriting Guidelines (Labeled Health Profile). The link is along the grey bar just below the App Request button. These are just guidelines, there are many other issues that can influence the underwriting process.
	                                    <br><br>
	                                    There are three drop down boxes at the top of the comparison page, "Benefit Amount", "Term Length" and the Model Premium. Changing the information in each of these three areas allows for instant re-quotes.

	                                    In most cases an appointment will be arranged for a licensed Nurse, Para-Med or a Doctor to visit with the applicant to perform a physical exam. The exam in most cases takes place at the applicants home or office. The extent of the exam is determined by the age and the amount of insurance the applicant is applying for. At the very least, the exam will include blood and urine and a blood pressure check. The cost of the exam is covered by the insurance carrier.

	                <p>
	                    Term insurance provides protection for a specific period of time. It pays a benefit only if you die during the term. The premiums are guaranteed during the level pay period. When purchasing a level term life insurance policy be sure you are aware of the guaranteed premium period. Once you have been approved and placed the policy in force with the first payment, the insurance company is obligated to keep the policy in force as long as you keep paying the premiums. You are not obligated to pay, but once you stop paying, the policy will lapse after usually a 30 day grace period. Some term insurance policies can be renewed when you reach the end of the level pay period. The premium rates increase at each renewal date. Most policies require that evidence of insurability be furnished at renewal for you to qualify for the lowest available rates.

	                <p>
	                	Take your time. On the other hand, don’t put off an important decision that would protect your family. Make sure you fully understand any policy you are considering and that you are comfortable with the company and product.<br><br>After you have purchased an insurance policy, keep in mind that you may have a “free-look” period usually 10 days after you receive the policy during which you can change your mind. During that period, read your policy carefully. If you decide not to keep the policy, the company will cancel the policy and give you an appropriate refund. Review the copy of your application contained in your policy. Promptly notify the agent or the company of any errors or missing information.
						<br><br>Review your policy periodically or when your situation changes to be sure your coverage is adequate.

	                <h3 class="header3">What happens if I fail to make a the required payments</h3>
	                <p>
	                	If you miss a premium payment, you typically have a 30- or 31-day grace period during which you can pay the premium with no interest charged. In a term policy at the end of the grace period if you do not make a payment the policy will lapse. In a permanent policy, the company can, with your authorization, draw from a permanent policy's cash surrender value to keep that policy in force as long as there is sufficient cash surrender value. In some flexible premium policies, premiums may be reduced or skipped as long as sufficient cash values remain in the policy. However, this will result in lower cash values.

	                        <li>Accelerated Death Benefit rider allows you to receive a portion of the proceeds of your life insurance policy before you die if you are diagnosed as terminally ill by a practicing, licensed physician. Availability and specifics varies by carrier and state. An accelerated death benefit rider is usually included on most term life insurance policies at no additional cost. It is important to note the amount accelerated is treated like a policy loan, and is deducted from the face amount of the policy along with any accrued interest and administrative fees.</li>
